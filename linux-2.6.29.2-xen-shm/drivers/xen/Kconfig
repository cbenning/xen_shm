        tristate "Backend driver support"
        default XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST
        help
          Support for backend device drivers that provide I/O services
          to other virtual machines.

config XEN_BLKDEV_BACKEND
	tristate "Block-device backend driver"
        depends on XEN_BACKEND
	default XEN_BACKEND
	help
	  The block-device backend driver allows the kernel to export its
	  block devices to other guests via a high-performance shared-memory
	  interface.

config XEN_BLKDEV_TAP
	tristate "Block-device tap backend driver"
	depends on XEN_BACKEND
	default XEN_BACKEND
	help
	  The block tap driver is an alternative to the block back driver
          and allows VM block requests to be redirected to userspace through
          a device interface.  The tap allows user-space development of
          high-performance block backends, where disk images may be implemented
          as files, in memory, or on other hosts across the network.  This
	  driver can safely coexist with the existing blockback driver.

config XEN_NETDEV_BACKEND
	tristate "Network-device backend driver"
        depends on XEN_BACKEND && NET

	  The network-device backend driver allows the kernel to export its

	  interface.

config XEN_NETDEV_PIPELINED_TRANSMITTER
	bool "Pipelined transmitter (DANGEROUS)"
	depends on XEN_NETDEV_BACKEND
	help
	  If the net backend is a dumb domain, such as a transparent Ethernet
	  bridge with no local IP interface, it is safe to say Y here to get
	  slightly lower network overhead.
	  If the backend has a local IP interface; or may be doing smart things
	  like reassembling packets to perform firewall filtering; or if you
	  are unsure; or if you experience network hangs when this option is
	  enabled; then you must say N here.

	tristate "PCI-device backend driver"
	depends on PCI && XEN_PRIVILEGED_GUEST && XEN_BACKEND

	select PCI_REASSIGN
	help
	  The PCI device backend driver allows the kernel to export arbitrary
	  PCI devices to other guests. If you select this to be a module, you
	  will need to make sure no other driver has bound to the device(s)
	  you want to make visible to other guests.

	default XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_CONTROLLER if IA64
	default XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_VPCI

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_VPCI
	bool "Virtual PCI"
	---help---
	  This PCI Backend hides the true PCI topology and makes the frontend
	  think there is a single PCI bus with only the exported devices on it.
	  For example, a device at 03:05.0 will be re-assigned to 00:00.0. A
	  second device at 02:1a.1 will be re-assigned to 00:01.1.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_PASS
	bool "Passthrough"
	---help---
	  This PCI Backend provides a real view of the PCI topology to the
	  frontend (for example, a device at 06:01.b will still appear at
	  06:01.b to the frontend). This is similar to how Xen 2.0.x exposed
	  PCI devices to its driver domains. This may be required for drivers
	  which depend on finding their hardward in certain bus/slot
	  locations.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_SLOT
	bool "Slot"
	---help---
	  This PCI Backend hides the true PCI topology and makes the frontend
	  think there is a single PCI bus with only the exported devices on it.
	  Contrary to the virtual PCI backend, a function becomes a new slot.
	  For example, a device at 03:05.2 will be re-assigned to 00:00.0. A
	  second device at 02:1a.1 will be re-assigned to 00:01.0.

config XEN_PCIDEV_BACKEND_CONTROLLER
	bool "Controller"
	depends on IA64
	---help---
	  This PCI backend virtualizes the PCI bus topology by providing a
	  virtual bus per PCI root device.  Devices which are physically under
	  the same root bus will appear on the same virtual bus.  For systems
	  with complex I/O addressing, this is the only backend which supports
	  extended I/O port spaces and MMIO translation offsets.  This backend
	  also supports slot virtualization.  For example, a device at
	  0000:01:02.1 will be re-assigned to 0000:00:00.0.  A second device
	  at 0000:02:05.0 (behind a P2P bridge on bus 0000:01) will be
	  re-assigned to 0000:00:01.0.  A third device at 0000:16:05.0 (under
	  a different PCI root bus) will be re-assigned to 0000:01:00.0.

config XEN_BLKDEV_FRONTEND
	tristate "Block-device frontend driver"

	help
	  The block-device frontend driver allows the kernel to access block
	  devices mounted within another guest OS. Unless you are building a
	  dedicated device-driver domain, or your master control domain
	  (domain 0), then you almost certainly want to say Y here.

config XEN_NETDEV_FRONTEND

	  The network-device frontend driver allows the kernel to access

config XEN_GRANT_DEV

	default y
	help
	  The framebuffer-device frontend drivers allows the kernel to create a
	  virtual framebuffer.  This framebuffer can be viewed in another
	  domain.  Unless this domain has access to a real video card, you
	  probably want to say Y here.

config XEN_KEYBOARD
	tristate "Keyboard-device frontend driver"
	depends on XEN_FRAMEBUFFER && INPUT
	default y
	help
	  The keyboard-device frontend driver allows the kernel to create a
	  virtual keyboard.  This keyboard can then be driven by another
	  domain.  If you've said Y to CONFIG_XEN_FRAMEBUFFER, you probably
	  want to say Y here.

config XEN_DISABLE_SERIAL
	bool "Disable serial port drivers"
	default y
	help
	  Disable serial port drivers, allowing the Xen console driver
	  to provide a serial console at ttyS0.

config XEN_SYSFS

	  The balloon driver allows the Xen domain to request more memory from

	  return unneeded memory to the system.

config XEN_SCRUB_PAGES
	bool "Scrub memory before freeing it to Xen"

	help
	  Erase memory contents before freeing it back to Xen's global
	  pool. This ensures that any secrets contained within that
	  memory (e.g., private keys) cannot be found by other guests that
	  may be running on the machine. Most people will want to say Y here.
	  If security is not a concern then you may increase performance by
	  saying N.
	  If in doubt, say yes.

config XENFS
	tristate "Xen filesystem"
	depends on PARAVIRT_XEN
	default y
	help
	  The xen filesystem provides a way for domains to share
	  information with each other and with the hypervisor.
	  For example, by reading and writing the "xenbus" file, guests
	  may pass arbitrary information to the initial domain.
	  If in doubt, say yes.

config XEN_COMPAT_XENFS
       bool "Create compatibility mount point /proc/xen"

       help
         The old xenstore userspace tools expect to find "xenbus"
         under /proc/xen, but "xenbus" is now found at the root of the
         xenfs filesystem.  Selecting this causes the kernel to create
         the compatibilty mount point /proc/xen if it is running on
         a xen platform.
         If in doubt, say yes.
